Custom Background Job Runner for Laravel
Overview
This package provides a custom background job runner for executing PHP classes as background jobs independently from Laravel's built-in queue system. It is designed to be scalable, robust, and easy to integrate into Laravel applications.

Features
Background Execution: Run PHP classes/methods in the background on Windows and Unix-based systems.
Error Handling: Logs errors and exceptions to a dedicated log file.
Retry Mechanism: Configurable retry attempts for failed jobs.
Security: Only pre-approved classes can be executed, with validation and sanitization of inputs.
Logging: Logs job execution details, including status (success/failure) and timestamps.
Requirements
PHP 7.4 or higher
Laravel 8 or higher
Composer
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/background-job-runner.git
Navigate to your Laravel project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-laravel-project
Copy the Background Job Runner files:

Place the BackgroundJobRunner.php in your app/Services directory.
Add the runBackgroundJob() function to your Laravel helper file.
Register your helper file: Add it to the autoload section in composer.json:

json
Copy code
"autoload": {
    "files": [
        "app/Helpers/your_helper_file.php"
    ]
}
Then run:

bash
Copy code
composer dump-autoload
Usage
Running a Background Job
Use the runBackgroundJob helper function to execute a job:

php
Copy code
runBackgroundJob('App\\Jobs\\ExampleJob', 'handle', ['param1', 'param2']);
Example Job Class
Create a job class that contains the logic you want to run in the background:

php
Copy code
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

class ExampleJob
{
    public function handle($param1, $param2)
    {
        // Your background job logic
    }
}
Configuration
Retry Attempts
You can configure the number of retry attempts in the BackgroundJobRunner.php file:

php
Copy code
protected $maxRetries = 3; // Default is 3
Error Logging
Logs errors to a file named background_jobs_errors.log in the storage/logs directory.

Security Considerations
Pre-approved Classes:
Only classes specified in the $allowedClasses array in BackgroundJobRunner.php can be executed.

php
Copy code
protected $allowedClasses = [
    'App\\Jobs\\ExampleJob',
    'App\\Jobs\\AnotherJob',
];
Input Validation:
Class names and methods are sanitized to prevent unauthorized code execution.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
PHP not found in PATH: Ensure PHP is correctly added to your systemâ€™s environment variables.
Permissions: Ensure the storage/logs directory is writable by your web server.
